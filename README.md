# Beverage Sales

## Objective
The objective of this project is to provide key insights into the sale of liquor from providers to Iowa Department of Commerce and then to retailers. This project looks at the supply chain of liquor from vendors to retailers in Iowa from 2023 to 2024 and examines trends in the sale of liquor ranging from volume amount, seasonal purchases, category of liquor, and so on. In this project, I organized and cleaned the data through Excel and then performed various union table queries to procure valuable insights in MySQL. I then visualized my findings using Tableau which can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chase.calero/viz/BeverageSales_17502114417530/Story1).

## About the Dataset
The dataset was acquired from Iowa Data - Iowa.gov and contains over 2 million rows of invoices comprised of liquor purchases, detailing the date, voume, state cost and state retail prices, store name, vendor name, and much more. The raw data can be accessed [here](https://data.iowa.gov/Sales-Distribution/Iowa-Liquor-Sales/m3tr-qhgy/about_data). The datasets were split, cleaned, organized, and formatted so as to contain only relevant columns (19 after clean) for the project. The cleaned dataset can be found in this repository.

## Conclusion of Project
Upon finishing the project, here were some of my most substantial findings:

1. Retailers stock up on liquor during summer and near the end of year.
2. 750 ml of liquor is the most popular bottle size, accounting for over 8 million bottles sold.
3. American Vodka is the most profitable drink in each of the four major counties.
4. High margin drinks lead to poor sales.
5. Diageo Americas is the highest grossing vendor with an above average state bottle cost.
